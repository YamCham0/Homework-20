            <p>Since I was a kid I have always dreamt about working with computers.
              Passionate about everything I do and attentive to little details, so much that is annoying.
              Imaginary squirrels will attack me and I'm in constant war with my cat over the keyboard.<br />
              Would like to be employed by a company that will help me grow in within the industry.<br />
              In search of new knowledge and experiences.
