            Passionate about everything I do and attentive to little details, so much that is annoying.
            Imaginary squirrels will attack me and I'm in constant war with my cat over the keyboard.<br />
            Would like to be employed by a company that will help me grow in within the industry.<br />
            In search of new knowledge and experience.
